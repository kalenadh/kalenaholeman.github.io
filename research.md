<strong>2023-2024</strong>

<br>

Selected as one of 20 for the sixth cohort of Mellon Research Scholars, a program at UH that seeks to support underrepresented humanities researchers, I expanded my FrameWorks research by looking into 20th-century Black womanist receptions of Dante’s Commedia and redefining the “journey motif,” using Gayl Jones’s <i>Corregidora</i>. I also critically interrogate early Black feminist criticism of the 20th century to reinterpret the concept of gender and psychological vs. sociopolitical journeying. Additionally, as part of the Mellon Research Scholars, I received professional graduate school training to promote diversity in humanities programs.

<h3> 3. Homeric Receptions in Black Diasporic Art </h3>

<div style="font-size:14px;text-align:justify;">

<strong>2023-2024</strong>

<br>

I was initially funded by UH's Provost's Undergraduate Research Scholarship to conduct a research project and create a digital exhibit exploring the role of women in Romare Bearden’s and Chris Ofili’s receptions of Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i>. To showcase my research, I wrote two essays and developed an Omeka-powered digital exhibition to be published through the UH Digital Humanities Core Initiative.

In summer 2023, I received department funding to conduct an archival research trip at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture’s Bearden papers. I also continued the project as a Digital Research Assistant for the UH Digital Research Commons fall 2023 and spring 2024.

I was the sole developer of the process and script for text cleaning and analysis for MacOS using OCR software, Python, and Voyant.

I analyzed metadata, wrote author personographies, contributed descriptions to the accompanying articles/website (including glossary definitions, data summaries, etc.). I also conducted digital archival research, compiled and analyzed information about the various sources in the dataset of 1k+ publications in London, Edinburgh, and Philadelphia in 1771.
